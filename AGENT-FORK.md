# Krita Agent: how this fork stays close to upstream

This is a fork of [KDE/krita](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/krita) `master`, built on Qt6. "Krita Agent" is a working
name; the artist chooses the final one (it is set in one place, `cmake/modules/KritaAppIdentity.cmake`). Krita is
GPL-3.0-or-later, and so is everything we add.

Our work lives on the branch `krita-agent`, rebased on upstream `master`. Upstream's history is never rewritten here.

## Where our changes go

The fork exists for long-term speed, so each change has to be cheap to carry through a rebase:

1. **New files first.** New code goes in new files: new libkis classes and methods in their own `.cpp`, new dockers
   and plugins in their own folders, and build helpers in `agent/`. New files almost never conflict.
2. **Small, listed edits to upstream files.** When an existing file has to change, keep the edit small: a call into
   our new code, a CMake option, or an extra branch. Add the file to the table below in the same commit.
3. **One feature per commit**, with a plain message saying what changed and why. A rebase conflict then names the
   feature that needs a look.
4. **Defaults match upstream when switched off.** Each edit is behind a configure option or identity value. With the
   option at upstream's value the code behaves exactly as stock Krita, so an edit can be offered upstream as it is.

## Upstream files we edit

Keep this table current: every upstream file the `krita-agent` branch changes, and why. New files are not listed
(they are ours); `git diff --stat master...krita-agent` lists everything.

| File | Why | Feature |
|---|---|---|
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `include(KritaAppIdentity)`: the build's identity options | identity (1.1) |
| `krita/CMakeLists.txt` | Bundle id and name from the identity; macOS Quick Look/Spotlight extensions optional (they need Xcode and claim Krita's file types); with its own identity the bundle opens `.kra` files only as an alternate app, never the default | identity (1.1) |
| `krita/main.cc` | `KisAppIdentity::initialize()` first; single-instance key, display name, organization domain, config and crash-log paths from the identity | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/global/CMakeLists.txt` | Builds `KisAppIdentity.cpp` and its generated `config-app-identity.h` | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/global/KisUsageLogger.cpp` | `krita.log`, `krita-sysinfo.log`, `kritacrash.log` in the identity's log folder | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/KisApplication.cpp` | `kritarc` reset/backup in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/KoDocumentInfo.cpp` | Author info read from the identity's `kritarc` | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/kis_config.cc` | `kritadisplayrc` and other config files in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/dialogs/kis_dlg_preferences.cc` | Same, for the preferences dialog | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/dialogs/KisDlgCustomTabletResolution.cpp` | Same, for the tablet resolution setting | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/ui/opengl/kis_opengl.cpp` | Same, for the OpenGL settings | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/widgetutils/kis_action_registry.cpp` | `kritashortcutsrc` in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/widgetutils/xmlgui/KisShortcutsEditor.cpp` | Same | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/widgetutils/xmlgui/kbugreport.cpp` | Logs read from the identity's log folder | identity (1.1) |
| `libs/widgetutils/xmlgui/kswitchlanguagedialog_p.cpp` | Language override file in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |
| `plugins/extensions/buginfo/DlgCrashLog.cpp`, `DlgKritaLog.cpp`, `DlgSysInfo.cpp`, `dlg_buginfo.cpp` | Logs read from the identity's folders | identity (1.1) |
| `plugins/tools/karbonplugins/tools/CalligraphyTool/KarbonCalligraphyOptionWidget.cpp` | `karboncalligraphyrc` in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |
| `plugins/python/scripter/scripter.py` | `krita-scripterrc` in the identity's config folder | identity (1.1) |

Our own files for the identity: `cmake/modules/KritaAppIdentity.cmake`, `libs/global/KisAppIdentity.{h,cpp}`,
`libs/global/config-app-identity.h.cmake`. Build helpers: `agent/`. This document: `AGENT-FORK.md`.

### What the identity does

With `KRITA_APP_SETTINGS_FOLDER=KritaAgent` (the fork's default; empty gives stock Krita's behaviour):

| | Stock Krita (macOS) | Krita Agent (macOS) |
|---|---|---|
| Bundle identifier | `org.krita` | `local.kritaagent` (placeholder until the name is chosen) |
| Organization domain | `krita.org` | `kritaagent.local` |
| Config (`kritarc`, `kritadisplayrc`, `kritashortcutsrc`, ...) | `~/Library/Preferences/` | `~/Library/Preferences/KritaAgent/` |
| Resources, resource database, Python plugins | `~/Library/Application Support/krita/` | `~/Library/Application Support/KritaAgent/krita/` |
| Logs (`krita.log`, `krita-sysinfo.log`) | `~/Library/Application Support/` | `~/Library/Application Support/KritaAgent/` |
| Caches | `~/Library/Caches/krita/` | `~/Library/Caches/KritaAgent/krita/` |
| macOS defaults (bundle-id domain) | `~/Library/Preferences/org.krita.plist` | `~/Library/Preferences/local.kritaagent.plist` (when macOS writes one) |
| Single-instance channel | `Krita5<home>` | `Krita5KritaAgent<home>` (the fork never hands its files to a running stock Krita) |

The application name stays `krita`, so installed data, translations and menus are found exactly as upstream finds
them. The organization name (empty upstream) is set to the settings folder, which is how Qt separates the data and
cache folders.

## Building and running (macOS, Qt6)

Only the Command Line Tools are needed (no Xcode); one architecture, the Mac's own.

```sh
# one-time setup (all ignored through .git/info/exclude): see the header of agent/fetch-deps.sh
agent/build-macos.sh          # fetch KDE's prebuilt Qt6 dependencies if needed, configure, build, install to _install
agent/run.sh                  # start _install/bin/krita.app (bundle id local.kritaagent)
```

`env.sh` (written by the dependency fetch) is an environment snapshot: never commit it. The fetch runs with a clean
environment so it holds no keys.

## Rebase cadence

- **Monthly**, in the first week of the month, onto the current upstream `master`:
  `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master krita-agent`.
- Before rebasing, tag the current state (`agent-YYYY-MM-pre-rebase`) so it can be compared and restored.
- After rebasing: rebuild (`agent/build-macos.sh --deps`, since KDE's dependency packages move with master), run the
  plugin's test suite and the Agent-mode test chats against the fork, and update the table above if a conflict changed
  what an edit touches.
- Out of cycle only for an upstream fix we need now, or before a release.
- Dependencies follow upstream's Qt6 branch of `krita-deps-management` (`transition.now/qt6` today; the branch name is
  in upstream's `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `DEPS_QT6_BRANCH_NAME_MACOS`). Read it at rebase time; do not assume it.

## What we offer upstream

Every change that would help any Krita script or user is offered to KDE as a merge request on invent.kde.org, written
against upstream `master` without our branding. If it is accepted, our copy goes away at the next rebase. In
particular:

- **Scripting speed (libkis):** region refresh (`Document.refreshProjection(QRect)`), `setPixelData` dirtying only its
  rect, document revision and changed-area reports, scaled projection views, async stroke jobs with per-job waits, and
  one named undo step per scripted operation.
- **Native craft:** brush tips and presets created from an area or image without a restart; merge kept work; bake
  filter masks.
- **Tool logic as functions:** similar-colour, contiguous and magnetic-outline selection moved out of the tool classes
  so scripts can call them.
- **Build:** the optional macOS integration extensions (building without Xcode) and the identity options, offered as
  "run a development build beside an installed Krita".

Kept in the fork (not offered): the built-in agent panel and project view, Krita-Revamp's interface port and the
Photoshop-style defaults, the canvas feature map until it has proven itself, and our branding.

## Licence

Every binary release publishes the exact source it was built from (this branch at the release tag) under
GPL-3.0-or-later, with Krita's, Krita-Revamp's, the bundled packages' and our MIT-origin licence notices. See the
release task (1.3).
